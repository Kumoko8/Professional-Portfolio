# Description
Thank you for visiting my page. Featured are some of my best and most enjoyable appplications from my time in bootcamp and beyond. I first got into the tech field because of my interest in the intersection of technology, design, and education. I am passionate about using software development to create web services that make learning and communication more effective, enjoyable, and aesthetically pleasing.
